            For many, education is synonymous with schooling, and with
            preparation for a subsequent career. From this perspective,
            education may seem like little more than a series of boxes to check:
            show up at class, learn the material, do the homework, pass the
            test, and, finally, get the diploma that gets you the job. This kind
            of rote, almost transactional experience of learning can be all too
            common, and it represents a misunderstanding of what it means to be
            an educator - or an educated person.
